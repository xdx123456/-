<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
&lt;object&gt;
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        An object to treat as the head of an unreachability trace.
</simpara>
<simpara>If no objects are given, <emphasis>git fsck</emphasis> defaults to using the
index file, all SHA-1 references in <emphasis>refs</emphasis> namespace, and all reflogs
(unless --no-reflogs is given) as heads.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>

--unreachable
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Print out objects that exist but that aren't reachable from any

<term>
--[no-]dangling
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Print objects that exist but that are never <emphasis>directly</emphasis> used (default).
        <emphasis>--no-dangling</emphasis> can be used to omit this information from the output.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>

--cache
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Consider any object recorded in the index also as a head node for
        an unreachability trace.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--no-reflogs
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Do not consider commits that are referenced only by an
        entry in a reflog to be reachable.  This option is meant
        only to search for commits that used to be in a ref, but
        now aren't, but are still in that corresponding reflog.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--full
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Check not just objects in GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY
        ($GIT_DIR/objects), but also the ones found in alternate
        object pools listed in GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES
        or $GIT_DIR/objects/info/alternates,
        and in packed Git archives found in $GIT_DIR/objects/pack
        and corresponding pack subdirectories in alternate
        object pools.  This is now default; you can turn it off
        with --no-full.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--connectivity-only
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Check only the connectivity of reachable objects, making sure
        that any objects referenced by a reachable tag, commit, or tree
        is present. This speeds up the operation by avoiding reading
        blobs entirely (though it does still check that referenced blobs
        exist). This will detect corruption in commits and trees, but
        not do any semantic checks (e.g., for format errors). Corruption
        in blob objects will not be detected at all.
</simpara>
<simpara>Unreachable tags, commits, and trees will also be accessed to find the
tips of dangling segments of history. Use <emphasis>--no-dangling</emphasis> if you don't
care about this output and want to speed it up further.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--strict
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Enable more strict checking, namely to catch a file mode
        recorded with g+w bit set, which was created by older
        versions of Git.  Existing repositories, including the
        Linux kernel, Git itself, and sparse repository have old
        objects that triggers this check, but it is recommended
        to check new projects with this flag.

--lost-found
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Write dangling objects into .git/lost-found/commit/ or
        .git/lost-found/other/, depending on type.  If the object is
        a blob, the contents are written into the file, rather than
        its object name.

<term>
--name-objects
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        When displaying names of reachable objects, in addition to the
        SHA-1 also display a name that describes <emphasis role="strong">how</emphasis> they are reachable,
        compatible with <xref linkend="git-rev-parse(1)" />, e.g.
        <emphasis>HEAD@{1234567890}~25^2:src/</emphasis>.

<term>
--[no-]progress
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by
        default when it is attached to a terminal, unless
        --no-progress or --verbose is specified. --progress forces
        progress status even if the standard error stream is not
        directed to a terminal.

<title>CONFIGURATION</title>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        During fsck git may find issues with legacy data which
        wouldn't be generated by current versions of git, and which
        wouldn't be sent over the wire if <emphasis>transfer.fsckObjects</emphasis> was
        set. This feature is intended to support working with legacy
        repositories containing such data.
</simpara>
<simpara>Setting <emphasis>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</emphasis> will be picked up by <xref linkend="git-fsck(1)" />, but
to accept pushes of such data set <emphasis>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</emphasis> instead, or
to clone or fetch it set <emphasis>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>The rest of the documentation discusses <emphasis>fsck.*</emphasis> for brevity, but the
same applies for the corresponding <emphasis>receive.fsck.*</emphasis> and
<emphasis>fetch.&lt;msg-id&gt;.*</emphasis>. variables.</simpara>
<simpara>Unlike variables like <emphasis>color.ui</emphasis> and <emphasis>core.editor</emphasis> the
<emphasis>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</emphasis> and <emphasis>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</emphasis> variables will not
fall back on the <emphasis>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</emphasis> configuration if they aren't set. To
uniformly configure the same fsck settings in different circumstances
all three of them they must all set to the same values.</simpara>
<simpara>When <emphasis>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</emphasis> is set, errors can be switched to warnings and
vice versa by configuring the <emphasis>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</emphasis> setting where the
<emphasis>&lt;msg-id&gt;</emphasis> is the fsck message ID and the value is one of <emphasis>error</emphasis>,
<emphasis>warn</emphasis> or <emphasis>ignore</emphasis>. For convenience, fsck prefixes the error/warning
with the message ID, e.g. "missingEmail: invalid author/committer
line - missing email" means that setting <emphasis>fsck.missingEmail = ignore</emphasis>
will hide that issue.</simpara>
<simpara>In general, it is better to enumerate existing objects with problems
with <emphasis>fsck.skipList</emphasis>, instead of listing the kind of breakages these
problematic objects share to be ignored, as doing the latter will
allow new instances of the same breakages go unnoticed.</simpara>
<simpara>Setting an unknown <emphasis>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</emphasis> value will cause fsck to die, but
doing the same for <emphasis>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</emphasis> and <emphasis>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</emphasis>
will only cause git to warn.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
fsck.skipList
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        The path to a list of object names (i.e. one unabbreviated SHA-1 per
        line) that are known to be broken in a non-fatal way and should
        be ignored. On versions of Git 2.20 and later comments (<emphasis>#</emphasis>), empty
        lines, and any leading and trailing whitespace is ignored. Everything
        but a SHA-1 per line will error out on older versions.
</simpara>
<simpara>This feature is useful when an established project should be accepted
despite early commits containing errors that can be safely ignored
such as invalid committer email addresses.  Note: corrupt objects
cannot be skipped with this setting.</simpara>
<simpara>Like <emphasis>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</emphasis> this variable has corresponding
<emphasis>receive.fsck.skipList</emphasis> and <emphasis>fetch.fsck.skipList</emphasis> variants.</simpara>
<simpara>Unlike variables like <emphasis>color.ui</emphasis> and <emphasis>core.editor</emphasis> the
<emphasis>receive.fsck.skipList</emphasis> and <emphasis>fetch.fsck.skipList</emphasis> variables will not
fall back on the <emphasis>fsck.skipList</emphasis> configuration if they aren't set. To
uniformly configure the same fsck settings in different circumstances
all three of them they must all set to the same values.</simpara>
<simpara>Older versions of Git (before 2.20) documented that the object names
list should be sorted. This was never a requirement, the object names
could appear in any order, but when reading the list we tracked whether
the list was sorted for the purposes of an internal binary search
implementation, which could save itself some work with an already sorted
list. Unless you had a humongous list there was no reason to go out of
your way to pre-sort the list. After Git version 2.20 a hash implementation
is used instead, so there's now no reason to pre-sort the list.</simpara>

<simplesect id="git-fsck(1)__discussion">
<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<simpara>git-fsck tests SHA-1 and general object sanity, and it does full tracking
of the resulting reachability and everything else. It prints out any
corruption it finds (missing or bad objects), and if you use the
<emphasis>--unreachable</emphasis> flag it will also print out objects that exist but that
aren't reachable from any of the specified head nodes (or the default
set, as mentioned above).</simpara>
<simpara>Any corrupt objects you will have to find in backups or other archives
(i.e., you can just remove them and do an <emphasis>rsync</emphasis> with some other site in
the hopes that somebody else has the object you have corrupted).</simpara>
<simpara>If core.commitGraph is true, the commit-graph file will also be inspected
using <emphasis>git commit-graph verify</emphasis>. See <xref linkend="git-commit-graph(1)" />.</simpara>
